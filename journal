Implementing the editing/saving functionality
The most basic function is to save field changes. Adding to an array, etc. can come later. To solve the problem of turning HTML into JSON, I looked at the flow of the display method:
1.	Get keys of object
2.	Iterate thru keys
  a.	Create newDiv
  b.	Build HTML elements
  c.	Make the HTML value equivalent to the key/value of the iteration
  d.	If itâ€™s an object, recurse into the next level before continuing iteration

Now how to reverse the process to read HTML as an object?
1.	Iterate thru divs, using class flags
  a.	Get values of elements
  b.	Build object
  c.	If it has a subdiv, recurse
